  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PartialSansKR
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/PartialSansKR-Regular.otf

    - family: SF-Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro.ttf
    - family: SF-Pro-Display
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Semibold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf
