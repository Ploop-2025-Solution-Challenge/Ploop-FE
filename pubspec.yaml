  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/ios_neutral_rd_na@4x.png
    - assets/images/onboarding-bg.jpg
    - assets/images/signin-logo.png
    - assets/images/onboarding-deco.png

    - assets/images/camera-icon.png
    - assets/images/dropdown-down.png

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PartialSansKR
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/PartialSansKR-Regular.otf

    - family: SF-Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro.ttf
    - family: SF-Pro-Display
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Semibold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
    - family: FugazOne
